06/07/19 21:20 Coach: Hi [Name], I see that your fitbit synced and I&apos;m floored -  You actually walked over 9,000 steps yesterday and over 12,000 steps today!! Incredible!! Keep up the amazing job!

07/29/19 07:00 Coach: <goal_setting gate:gateId="440" phase="goal_identification">Good morning [Name]! This is the last week! I was wondering if we could chat a bit about your last week&apos;s goal?</goal_setting> 

07/29/19 07:10 Coach: Could we push ourselves a little bit and maybe shoot for a goal that matches the number of steps you usually walk during the week? For example, during a work week it seems like you walk close to 10,000 steps but you&apos;ve only been setting your goals at 3,000

07/29/19 07:10 Coach: Would you like to set your goal a little higher and finish the last week off with a bang?

07/29/19 07:20 Patient: Good morning  [Name]! Yes I can push for goals this week 

07/29/19 07:22 Coach: <goal_setting gate:gateId="441" phase="goal_refining">Great! So how many steps do you think we could go for this last week?</goal_setting>

07/29/19 07:34 Coach: <goal_setting gate:gateId="442" phase="solve_barrier">Okay, and what will you do to make sure you reach that goal?</goal_setting> 

07/29/19 07:49 Patient: Walk 

07/29/19 07:51 Coach: Lets be a little more specific - for example if you realize by the end of the work day that you haven&apos;t reached your goal yet, do you have a plan to make sure you get those steps in at home? 

07/29/19 07:51 Coach: Or for example, will you put some extra steps in throughout the work day during your break, etc? 

07/29/19 08:04 Patient: Yes not at work today! Be back tomorrow.

07/29/19 08:05 Coach: <goal_setting gate:gateId="443" phase="anticipate_barrier">Okay last 2 questions: 1) will you start 11,000 steps today and until Friday? and then 2) how confident are you with reaching your goal? (scale of 1-10)</goal_setting>

07/29/19 08:07 Patient: Yes I will start today! I&apos;m confident scale 10

07/29/19 08:43 Coach: Great! So your last goal is to walk 11,000 steps Monday - Friday this week. I will check in with you on Monday.
