06/24/19 10:44 Patient: We can try

06/24/19 10:51 Coach: Okay! last question: How confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10? 1 = not at all, and 10 = absolutely 100%

Does that sound right?

07/19/19 12:04 Coach: Hi [Name], would you mind manually syncing your fitbit for me? You just need to go to the fitbit app and swipe your finger down. Thank you! 

07/21/19 20:00 Coach: Hi [Name], I&apos;m texting you to set up your 7th fitbit goal a little early since I will be away for part of the week. What would you like your new fitbit goal to be?

07/25/19 09:38 Coach: Hi [Name], it looks like you figured out and just synced it. Thank you so much! 

07/25/19 09:39 Coach: I have a question: did you wear your fitbit this week? I don&apos;t have any data so I just want to be sure. 

07/25/19 09:41 Patient: No I don&apos;t wear I just put it on today

07/25/19 09:43 Coach: Oh I see. Did you happen to wear it last week? 

07/25/19 09:49 Patient: No 

07/25/19 09:50 Coach: Okay, thanks for confirming. I thought the data was faulty. 

07/25/19 09:52 Coach: I will check in with you at the end of the week to make sure everything is set. Thanks!

07/25/19 09:54 Patient: Ok thanks 

07/26/19 07:00 Coach: Good morning [Name]! This is just a reminder to get your <Specificity gate:gateId="258" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> in today :) Last day of week 7!

07/26/19 07:07 Patient: Good morning [Name],Ok

07/29/19 07:00 Coach: Good morning [Name]! This is the last week! I was wondering if we could chat a bit about your last week&apos;s goal? 

07/29/19 07:10 Coach: Could we push ourselves a little bit and maybe shoot for a goal that matches the number of <Specificity gate:gateId="262" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> you usually <Specificity gate:gateId="259" specType="activity">walk</Specificity> during the week? For example, during a work week it seems like you <Specificity gate:gateId="274" specType="activity">walk</Specificity> close to <Measurability gate:gateId="260" quantityType="number" stage="previous" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">10,000 steps</Measurability> but you&apos;ve only been setting your goals at <Measurability gate:gateId="261" quantityType="number" stage="previous" measureType="quantity">3,000</Measurability>

07/29/19 07:10 Coach: Would you like to set your goal a little higher and finish the last week off with a bang?

07/29/19 07:20 Patient: Good morning  [Name]! Yes I can push for goals this week 

07/29/19 07:22 Coach: Great! So how many <Specificity gate:gateId="275" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> do you think we could go for this last week? 

07/29/19 07:28 Patient: We going to push <Measurability gate:gateId="263" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">11,000</Measurability>

07/29/19 07:34 Coach: Okay, and what will you do to make sure you reach that goal? 

07/29/19 07:49 Patient: <Specificity gate:gateId="264" specType="activity">Walk</Specificity> 

07/29/19 07:51 Coach: Lets be a little more specific - for example if you realize by the end of the work day that you haven&apos;t reached your goal yet, do you have a plan to make sure you get those <Specificity gate:gateId="265" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> in <Specificity gate:gateId="267" specType="location" stage="other">at home</Specificity>? 

07/29/19 07:51 Coach: Or for example, will you put some extra <Specificity gate:gateId="266" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> in throughout the work day during your break, etc? 

07/29/19 08:04 Patient: Yes not at work today! Be back tomorrow.

07/29/19 08:05 Coach: Okay last 2 questions: 1) will you start <Measurability gate:gateId="268" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">11,000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="269" days="name" measureType="days">today and until Friday</Measurability>? and then 2) how confident are you with reaching your goal? (scale of 1-10)

07/29/19 08:07 Patient: Yes I will start today! I&apos;m confident scale <Attainability gate:gateId="270" infoType="score">10</Attainability>

07/29/19 08:43 Coach: Great! So your last goal is to <Specificity gate:gateId="271" specType="activity">walk</Specificity> <Measurability gate:gateId="272" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">11,000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="273" days="name" measureType="days">Monday - Friday</Measurability> this week. I will check in with you on Monday. 

07/29/19 08:43 Coach: Sorry Wednesday*
