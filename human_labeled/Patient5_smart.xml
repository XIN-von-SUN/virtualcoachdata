05/06/19 10:37 Coach: Test Hello [Name]

05/06/19 11:00 Coach: Thanks for being so patient with us setting up your fitbit, [Name]!

05/06/19 12:00 Coach: Welcome to the walking study, [Name]! This is [Name].  I am going to be your health coach.  We are going to start out with a goal of <Measurability gate:gateId="272" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">2000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="273" measureType="repetition">per day</Measurability>.  

05/06/19 12:10 Patient: Ok thanks

05/06/19 12:11 Patient: I already did over <Measurability gate:gateId="274" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">2000 steps</Measurability>

05/06/19 12:28 Coach: Great job, [Name]!  You met your goal for today!  As you mentioned, you weren&apos;t sure how many <Specificity gate:gateId="268" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> you <Specificity gate:gateId="302" specType="activity">walked</Specificity>....we will be able to find out.  And remember <Measurability gate:gateId="282" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">2000 steps</Measurability> equals <Measurability gate:gateId="283" quantityType="distance" measureType="quantity">one mile</Measurability>.  Keep up the good work.

05/06/19 12:30 Patient: Thanks

05/07/19 13:52 Patient: I think maybe i should set my goals to <Measurability gate:gateId="275" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">6000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="276" measureType="repetition">per day</Measurability>

05/07/19 14:39 Coach: Let&apos;s stay at <Measurability gate:gateId="277" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">2000</Measurability> for <Measurability gate:gateId="278" measureType="repetition">every day</Measurability> this week and then you can just <Specificity gate:gateId="300" specType="activity">walk</Specificity> more if you want.  I see you almost hit <Measurability gate:gateId="301" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">6000</Measurability> today!  Also that you charged it.  You are doing wonderfully...

05/07/19 15:17 Patient: Ok thanks

05/08/19 15:16 Patient: Sorry i did not here from you today

05/09/19 10:56 Coach: Hi [Name]!  I see you hit over <Measurability gate:gateId="279" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">6000</Measurability> yesterday as well! It&apos;s looking like rain today so just remember that if you don&apos;t make <Measurability gate:gateId="280" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="other">6000</Measurability> -- it&apos;s ok because your goal this week is <Measurability gate:gateId="281" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">2000</Measurability>.  I know that&apos;s low but you can raise it next week.  This is just the first week.  Have a great day

05/09/19 11:38 Patient: Thank you

05/10/19 11:00 Coach: You are enough....just as you are.  You are the best you that will ever be and you are beautiful.

05/10/19 11:05 Patient: Not sure if this text is for me but thanks

05/10/19 14:26 Coach: Yes - it was for you.  Just trying to give you a little extra motivation.  Do you like it or want to stick to the goals?

05/10/19 14:50 Patient: Thank you [Name]

05/11/19 14:00 Coach: Every day is a new beginning. Take a deep breath, smile, and start again.

05/11/19 14:08 Patient: Ok thanks

05/13/19 10:30 Coach: Happy Monday [Name]!  So you really did amazing in your first week of the study. What goal would you like to set for this week?  Remember that you want it to be one you are totally confident you can reach. 

05/13/19 13:19 Patient: I decided to set the goal for <Measurability gate:gateId="284" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">6000</Measurability>...

05/15/19 17:22 Coach: You want your goal to be <Measurability gate:gateId="285" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">6000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="286" measureType="repetition">each day</Measurability>.  I see you made it on Monday.  Just missed it yesterday.  How confident are you that you can do <Measurability gate:gateId="287" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">6000</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="288" measureType="repetition">each day</Measurability> this week?  1 is not at all confident.  10 is extremely confident.

05/15/19 18:41 Patient: <Attainability gate:gateId="289" infoType="score">5</Attainability>

05/15/19 19:24 Coach: It&apos;s nicer to pick a goal that you know you can reach.  Remember, we have 7 more weeks to go.  You can increase your <Specificity gate:gateId="392" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> slowly.  What is a little more than last week&apos;s <Measurability gate:gateId="290" quantityType="number" stage="previous" measureType="quantity">2000 steps</Measurability> that would feel like something you could do for sure?

05/15/19 19:33 Patient: I honestly believe I can do alease <Measurability gate:gateId="291" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000</Measurability> or more so maybe i will just set my goal at <Measurability gate:gateId="292" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000</Measurability>.

05/15/19 19:35 Coach: Sounds like you are pretty confident about that.  <Measurability gate:gateId="293" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="294" measureType="repetition">a day</Measurability>.  That&apos;s double last week -- it&apos;s up to you.  On that scale of 1 to 10 - with 10 being completely sure you can do it - how sure are you that you can <Specificity gate:gateId="303" specType="activity">walk</Specificity> <Measurability gate:gateId="295" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="296" measureType="repetition">every day</Measurability> this week?

05/15/19 19:35 Patient: Very sure about <Measurability gate:gateId="297" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000</Measurability>

05/15/19 19:37 Coach: So it sounds like a <Attainability gate:gateId="298" infoType="score">10</Attainability>!  That&apos;s what we want. Goals that you feel 100% confident you can do.  So between today and next Monday, your goal is to <Specificity gate:gateId="304" specType="activity">walk</Specificity> at least <Measurability gate:gateId="299" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="305" measureType="repetition">each day</Measurability>.  If you <Specificity gate:gateId="306" specType="activity">walk</Specificity> more, that&apos;s fine.  Thanks for working with me.

05/15/19 20:21 Patient: Thank you.

05/16/19 13:21 Coach: Good afternoon [Name].  It looks like you may not have your fitbit on?  Just wanted to check.  I hope you are ok and just forgot to put it on. 

05/16/19 14:25 Patient: I think i put it on around 9:00  today don&apos;t quite remember 

05/16/19 14:28 Coach: Hmm. I can&apos;t see it on my end.  Did you happen to turn off bluetooth?

05/16/19 14:31 Patient: No I dont think so

05/16/19 14:51 Patient: Can you see it now on your end.

05/16/19 14:52 Coach: No -- thanks for trying.  I will try to figure it out.  You keep up the good work.

05/16/19 14:53 Patient: Ok

05/16/19 14:59 Coach: When you get a chance, can you just swipe your finger from the top of your phone down?  Sometimes that will fix this problem.  Thanks!

05/16/19 15:00 Patient: Ok i swipe down

05/16/19 15:01 Patient: I hope that solve the problem

05/16/19 15:02 Coach: Thanks for working with me on this, [Name]. It still isn&apos;t picking it up.  I am going to do some searching.  You just keep <Specificity gate:gateId="269" specType="activity">walking</Specificity>...

05/16/19 15:04 Patient: I did not charge it up last nite but I did not need to you think that might be a problem

05/16/19 15:06 Coach: I am not sure but that is very good thinking. 

05/16/19 15:07 Patient: I have over <Measurability gate:gateId="307" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">2000 steps</Measurability> already

05/16/19 15:08 Coach: Great job! Thanks for letting me know.  Stay dry as they say we are in for some rain over the next few days.

05/17/19 15:19 Coach: Hi [Name]!  I hope you are having a good day.  When you get a chance could you try this  --- push the button on the side of the fitbit down and hold it down for about 15 seconds.   You fitbit screen should turn off and then come right back on. Thanks!!  I am still trying to figure out why I can&apos;t see your <Specificity gate:gateId="393" specType="activity">steps</Specificity>.

05/17/19 15:40 Patient: I am over <Measurability gate:gateId="308" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">3000 steps</Measurability> I hope you are able to see it...I also pushed the button on the side I hope I did not mess up

05/17/19 15:48 Coach: Great job on the <Specificity gate:gateId="394" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> -- I appreciate you trying to fix the issue.  I just can&apos;t figure out why it stopped showing me the <Specificity gate:gateId="395" specType="activity">steps</Specificity>.  I still can&apos;t see but good to know you are <Specificity gate:gateId="309" specType="activity">walking</Specificity>...

05/17/19 19:25 Patient: Well I had a pretty good day and I am getting ready to charge my phone up I completed my goal I have over <Measurability gate:gateId="310" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">4700 steps</Measurability>.

05/17/19 19:56 Coach: I hope that you are proud of yourself.  You are setting goals and moving forward. Making it happen!!  

05/18/19 21:21 Patient: Getting ready for bed i have <Measurability gate:gateId="311" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">4794 steps</Measurability> i hope you can see them on your end..

05/19/19 08:57 Coach: Good morning [Name]!  Thanks for updating me on your <Specificity gate:gateId="396" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> yesterday.  Sadly, I still cannot see your <Specificity gate:gateId="397" specType="activity">steps</Specificity>.  But excellent job!  You are <Specificity gate:gateId="312" specType="activity">walking</Specificity> about <Measurability gate:gateId="313" quantityType="distance" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">2.5 miles</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="314" measureType="repetition">each day</Measurability>!  That&apos;s wonderful.  You are on track to meet your goal of <Measurability gate:gateId="315" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="316" measureType="repetition">every day</Measurability> this week.  <Measurability gate:gateId="317" days="number" measureType="days" status="remaining">One more day</Measurability>.  

05/19/19 09:28 Patient: Gm and thank you

05/20/19 10:00 Coach: Happy Monday, [Name]!  You went from <Measurability gate:gateId="318" quantityType="number" stage="previous" measureType="quantity">2000 steps</Measurability> in week 1 up to <Measurability gate:gateId="319" quantityType="number" stage="previous" measureType="quantity">4000 steps</Measurability> in week 2.  That was a huge jump. I want you to pick a goal for this week that you feel sure you can do.  Think about how easy or hard it was to get in your <Measurability gate:gateId="320" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000 steps</Measurability> as you set your goal for this week. I will text you in an hour to see what goal you are considering. 

05/20/19 10:13 Patient: Ok

05/20/19 11:00 Coach: Hi again, [Name].  What are you thinking for this week&apos;s goal?  On a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being totally sure you can do it - how sure are you?  

05/20/19 12:29 Patient: Im positive I can only do <Measurability gate:gateId="321" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000</Measurability> I can&apos;t move up at this time remember I told you that I&apos;m not very active

05/20/19 13:50 Coach: Excellent [Name]! <Measurability gate:gateId="322" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000 steps</Measurability> it is! There is no pressure for you to increase those <Specificity gate:gateId="398" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> at all.  I just want you to set goals that you feel you can meet.  This next week you are going to get <Measurability gate:gateId="323" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="324" measureType="repetition">per day</Measurability>.  That is <Measurability gate:gateId="325" quantityType="distance" measureType="quantity">2 miles</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="326" measureType="repetition">each day</Measurability>.

05/20/19 13:54 Patient: I know that not a lot but i honestly feel that all I can do

05/23/19 16:21 Coach: I hope you have been able to enjoy the nice weather these past couple of days.  Looks like rain is on the way. How have you been doing with the <Measurability gate:gateId="327" quantityType="number" stage="other" measureType="quantity">2000 steps</Measurability>?

05/23/19 17:25 Patient: I&apos;ve <Specificity gate:gateId="329" specType="activity">walked</Specificity> over <Measurability gate:gateId="328" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">2000</Measurability> i been doing over <Measurability gate:gateId="330" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4000</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="331" measureType="repetition">daily</Measurability>

05/28/19 08:53 Coach: Good morning [Name]!  I hope you are well.

That&apos;s excellent!  What goal would you like to set for this week?  The most important thing is that it is a goal you feel you can reach. 

05/28/19 08:54 Patient: Maybe I will go for <Measurability gate:gateId="334" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability>..

05/28/19 08:55 Coach: [Name] -  I can see all of your <Specificity gate:gateId="399" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> now!!  I don&apos;t know what happened but I can see what a great job you are doing. You <Specificity gate:gateId="335" specType="activity">walked</Specificity> <Measurability gate:gateId="336" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">9500 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="270" days="number" measureType="days" status="accomplished">one day</Measurability> last week!!  That is almost <Measurability gate:gateId="337" quantityType="distance" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">5 miles</Measurability>!!!  How confident are you that you can do <Measurability gate:gateId="338" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability>?  Scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being totally confident.

05/28/19 08:59 Patient: Yes I was extremely busy that day and Sat i left home without my fibit but I am confident that I can do <Measurability gate:gateId="339" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability>. So I say <Attainability gate:gateId="340" infoType="score">10</Attainability>

05/28/19 16:25 Coach: Excellent - so for this week you are increasing your <Specificity gate:gateId="400" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> to <Measurability gate:gateId="341" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="342" measureType="repetition">each day</Measurability>. Thanks for letting me know that you had zero steps one day because you forgot the fitbit.  Good to know.

05/30/19 11:57 Coach: [Name] - I see that you <Specificity gate:gateId="343" specType="activity">walked</Specificity> over <Measurability gate:gateId="344" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity" status="accomplished">5000 steps</Measurability> the past 2 days.Yea!!! For someone who says they aren&apos;t active, you sure are <Specificity gate:gateId="345" specType="activity">walking</Specificity> alot.  How is this larger goal for you?

05/30/19 11:59 Patient: It&apos;s working fine maybe next week I will set my goal at <Measurability gate:gateId="346" quantityType="number" stage="other" measureType="quantity">5000</Measurability>..Thank you

05/30/19 15:35 Coach:   Doing a great job! I am glad it&apos;s not too much for now.

05/30/19 15:44 Patient: Ok thx

06/03/19 10:26 Coach: [Name] - looks like you were walking <Specificity gate:gateId="347" specType="activity" stage="other">stairs</Specificity> yesterday -- <Measurability gate:gateId="348" quantityType="number" stage="other" measureType="quantity">4 floors</Measurability>.  You are starting week 5 this week.  Over halfway finished with the study.  What sounds like a good goal for this week? 

06/03/19 11:09 Patient: <Measurability gate:gateId="349" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">5000</Measurability>

06/03/19 11:11 Coach: How confident are you that you can do <Measurability gate:gateId="350" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">5000 steps</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="351" measureType="repetition">everyday</Measurability>?  The scale is 1 to 10 with 10 being &quot;totally confident - I can definitely do that&quot;  

06/03/19 11:12 Patient: Maybe <Attainability gate:gateId="352" infoType="score">8</Attainability>

06/03/19 11:16 Coach: I think that you are doing an amazing job <Specificity gate:gateId="353" specType="activity">walking</Specificity>.  You started at <Measurability gate:gateId="354" quantityType="number" stage="previous" measureType="quantity">2000</Measurability> and have gone up to <Measurability gate:gateId="355" quantityType="number" stage="previous" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability>.  Let&apos;s stick with <Measurability gate:gateId="356" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability> for another week instead of pushing to much to fast.  How confident are you that you could do <Measurability gate:gateId="357" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability> <Measurability gate:gateId="358" measureType="repetition">each day</Measurability> this coming week?  It&apos;s also ok to do fewer <Specificity gate:gateId="401" specType="activity">steps</Specificity> during a really busy week if you want to do fewer than <Measurability gate:gateId="359" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability>.  

06/03/19 11:55 Patient: Ok <Measurability gate:gateId="360" quantityType="number" measureType="quantity">4500</Measurability> sounds good for another week

06/05/19 14:56 Coach: Good afternoon [Name]!
